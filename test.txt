Candy are hard to find in my area. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!

I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat fish.
--> great product

I started drinking the Thai Nguyen tea when I was on the Thai Nguyen diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I drink them all the time. It helps keep me happy all day, no matter how long.
--> great tea

I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.
--> 4 Stars for price and taste
--> good chips

We are Chocolate Moose & Mickey Moose, Our nice owner bought this great food for us.  We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickey's food when he isn't looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :)
--> GOOD FOOD! xxx


They are the ROLO's I've aways enjoyed. Great Chocolate, delicious caremel. Great for watching a good movie, or show. And they don't raise my blood sugar very much, I'm diabetic.Enjoy!...:)
--> I think they are Great!
--> great taste


My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  Banana and Mango are two of her favorite flavors.  The melts themselves are a smaller size than the Gerber melts, which is nice for younger babies.  I was always breaking the Gerber melts into 3 or 4 pieces, which got a little messy.  I don't have to do that with these melts.  These are tasty AND organic.  We've had a lot of success with all of the Happy Baby products we've tried.  Highly recommend.
--> My daughter loves these
--> great for kids


Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.
